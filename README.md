## There are 2 Versions
- Fast `main.py` Easy to set up, Works on any computer 
- Faster `main_onnx.py` May need to edit a file, Works on any computer 

## Requirements
- Nvidia RTX 980, higher or equivalent
- And one of the following:
  - Nvidia CUDA Toolkit 11.8 [DOWNLOAD HERE](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive)

## Pre-setup Steps
1. Download and Unzip the AI Aimbot and stash the folder somewhere handy.
2. Ensure you've got Python installed â€“ grab version 3.11 [HERE](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3116/).

3. Fire up `PowerShell` or `Command Prompt` on Windows.
4. To install `PyTorch`, select the appropriate command based on your GPU.
    - Nvidia `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118`
    - AMD or CPU `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio`
5. Run the command below to install the required Open Source packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run (Fast Version)
Follow these steps **after** Python and all packages have been installed:

1. Open `PowerShell` or `Command Prompt`.
2. Input `cd `, then drag & drop the folder containing the bot code into the terminal.
3. Hit Enter.
4. Type `python main.py` and press Enter.
5. Use **CAPS_LOCK** to toggle the aimbot. It begins in the *off* state.
6. Pressing `q` at **ANY TIME** will shut down the program.

## How to Run (Faster Version)
Follow these steps **after** Python and all packages have been installed:

1. Open the `config.py` file and tweak the `onnxChoice` variable to correspond with your hardware specs:
    - `onnxChoice = 1` # CPU ONLY
    - `onnxChoice = 2` # AMD/NVIDIA ONLY
    - `onnxChoice = 3` # NVIDIA ONLY 
2. IF you have an NVIDIA set up, run the following
    ```
    pip install onnxruntime-gpu
    pip install cupy-cuda11x
    ```
2. Follow the same steps as for the Fast Version above except for step 4, you will run `python main_onnx.py` instead.

## Configurable Settings

*Default settings are generally great for most scenarios. Check out the comments in the code for more insights. The configuration settings are now located in the `config.py` file!<br>
**CAPS_LOCK is the default for flipping the switch on the autoaim superpower!**

`useMask` - Set to `True` or `False` to turn on and off 

`maskWidth` - The width of the mask to use. Only used when `useMask` is `True` 

`maskHeight` - The height of the mask to use. Only used when `useMask` is `True` 

`aaQuitKey` - The go-to key is `q`, but if it clashes with your game style, swap it out!

`headshot_mode` - Set to `False` if you're aiming to keep things less head-on and more centered. 

`cpsDisplay` - Toggle off with `False` if you prefer not to display the CPS in your command station.

`visuals` - Flip to `True` to witness the AI's vision! Great for sleuthing out any hiccups. 

`aaMovementAmp` - The preset should be on point for 99% of players. Lower the digits for smoother targeting. Recommended doses: `0.5` - `2`. 

`confidence` - Stick with the script here unless you're the expert.

`screenShotHeight` - Same as above, no need for changes unless you've got a specific vision.

`screenShotWidth` - Keep it constant as is, unless you've got reasons to adjust.

`aaDetectionBox` - Default's your best bet, change only if you've got the know-how. 

`onnxChoice` - Gear up for the right graphics cardâ€”Nvidia, AMD, or CPU power!

`centerOfScreen` - Keep this switched on to stay in the game's heart.
